          <h4>What got me into photoshop</h4>
          <h5>twitch.tv/theshadowcos</h5>
          <p>I got into photoshop because I want to make some art for my twitch channel, instead of paying someone else to do it for me. I also though it would be a good thing to learn so i can help my friends out when they start streaming</p>
